# Atheros-5k-driver_-Long-distance-Wi-Fi-

With the growing network size and application domains, these are increasing tremendously. In this case, a low latency and high capacity backbone network is essential. WiFi-based Long Distance (WiLD) networks have proven to be a suitable solution for extending connectivity towards rural areas. However, due to the long distance links connected by directional antennas, high propagation delays and interference exist. An efficient TDMA-based MAC protocol for multi-hop WiLD networks called 2C has improved end-to-end performance using an interference-aware node coloring algorithm. In this work, we have implemented 2C MAC protocol over real-life testbed. The implementation incorporates different features of 2C such as tight synchronization over multi-hop and 2C color scheduling based data transmission. Using spatial reuse mechanism of 2C, the implemented testbed shows better performances in terms of saturation throughput and end-to-end delay than other relevant MAC protocols. We also analyze the device to cloud latency and energy consumption in an IoT environment. The note files constains details about the implementation process.
